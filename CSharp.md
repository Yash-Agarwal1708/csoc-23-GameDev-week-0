# **Welcome to C#** : *What Java should have been*

Hello participants! Glad to have you exploring GameDev, and for now, Unity!

It's no secret that games are just programs, so to make them, you need a programming language. Ideally, a fast, multi-paradigm, convenient, very-well used (maybe like top 5?) programming language and with amazing documentation.

C# is one the few ones that ticks all these boxes. It's modern, expressive, powerful, extremely well-designed, functional, and has one of the biggest communities and companies backing it up - Microsoft. It's also cross platform, and has some amazing frameworks like Avalonia, ASP.NET, MAUI, Blazor and MonoGame. And MSDN is pretty much the best language documentation ever written. **Am I fanboying for .NET and C#? Yes. Absolutely. *Who wouldn't?***

# Getting Started - Setting up the tools

## The Compiler and Runtime

C# is compiled and run using something called *.NET*. The latest stable version, as of writing this, is .NET 7, although .NET 5 and .NET 6 are fine too.

You can find the instructions to install on any platform, *by any means*, in the link(s) given below. Told you, Microsoft's and Mozilla's developers write the best goddamn documentation.

1. Here are the instructions to install it:
[For pretty much every OS used at scale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/)

2. [Here's Scott Hanselman, a very fun guy, telling you about what .NET actually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/net-core-101/what-is-net). Don't like watching videos? [Read it here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet?&WT.mc_id=Educationaldotnet-c9-scottha)

## What IDE/Text editor should I use?

- *On Windows?* **Visual Studio 2022.** Install the "Desktop Development" and "Game Dev with Unity" packages through the installer. Watch a youtube video, or google if you're confused. You're a programmer, this is how you find information.

- *PC not powerful, or not on Windows (like Mac or Linux)?* You can use **VS Code with the C# extension by Micrsosoft**, or, if you have a student license for Jetbrains, **Jetbrains Rider** (Jetbrains IDEs are always awesome).

# Getting Started - Learning C#

Alright, here's the best bit.

- [Here's a quick slideshow to catch up on some features and syntax](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yINT1ow9OrnAL-SfIJyMFAxThX4ssQIcrK8Rkv1PqEo/edit#slide=id.p)

- Learn how to do a hello world in C#: [here, it's Scott again!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT2VR7m19So&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN)

- C# for beginners: [Complete Video Series, again by Scott and Microsoft themselves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVxKLQCHpiUWun7vlJJvUiN)

- How I started learning C#: [C# tutorials by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p0JLFZj2C8&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvRX6xK1oi0reKci6ignjdSa) They're slightly old, but the basics are still pretty good.

- You can do a [tour of C#]() or [interactive C#](), if you've done things like these before, or if you just want to get hands-on with things in your browser.

# Your Bible for C# and .NET

Go here: [*You'll find everything to learn here, and the quality is unparalleled. Go crazy.*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website).

You can learn to build anything - simple console apps, cross-platform desktop apps, mobile apps, ML models, Web servers, WASM-based stuff, right there on that link, all in C# and .NET (or F#, if that's your jazz).

# What next?

- ***Build stuff!*** What else? That's how you learn programming, and that's how you learn a programming language. You don't read about using a hammer and think you know it, you use it. Same thing.

- Although this is not a requirement, we would like you **make something**, ***anything***, in C# and make a pull request on this repo. Doesn't matter what it is, how big it is (just don't send us a hello world PR). Who knows, maybe we might use it for extra points later ;)
