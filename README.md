Unity is game engine which we will be using to create our games.

In order to install Unity you need to follow the following steps:

1. Visit the official [Unity Website](https://unity.com/download) and download the installer using any web browser. 

2. Click on Download Unity Hub, downloading of the executable file will start shortly. 
3. Locate the installer file and start the installer.
4. Just keep everything default and click on next.
After the installation is completed open the unity hub and you should have the following window opened up.

Click on the install button beside the recommended version under LONG TERM SUPPORT(LTS) under offial releases tab. 
The recommended version is generally more stable and with less chances of crashes.

When you get to this screen, make sure that the checkbox in front of “Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019” is unchecked. We would be using vscode to code our game.
