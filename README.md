Unity is a game engine which we will be using to create our games.

2. Click on Download Unity Hub, downloading of the executable file will start shortly. 
3. Locate the installer file and start the installer.
4. Just keep everything default and click on next.
After the installation is completed open the unity hub and you should have the following window opened up.
